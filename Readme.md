## OVERVIEW	
Farming is one of the major sectors that influence a countryâ€™s economic growth. But most of the time this sector gets neglected. So we thought of creating a platform where landlords and farmers can come together. FARMERS CHOOSE WHO THEY WORK FOR so that they can generate more revenue working on the land offered to them by the landlords.  Apart from this we will also provide SOLUTION FOR CONTROLING CROP DAMAGE CAUSED BY INFECTED PLANTS .So we introduce AGROMATE .
## OBJECTIVE
The objective of AGROMATE is to ensure they are not paid below minimum wages  and that they can earn more by selecting which landlord they want to work for. It will also help control crop damage caused by infected plants.
